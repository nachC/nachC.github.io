							<h1>Hi, I’m Ignacio</h1>
							<p>Here you'll find my projects</p>
						</header>
						<p>I'm currently learning software development on my own time (plus what I
							can learn in my job as a Technical Support Engineer). I aspire to be a Software Developer.
							In
							code I've found a beautiful world where I can get lost in, and enjoy the ride.<br></br>
							I'm currently working as a Technical Support Engineer for Google Workspace (disclaimer:
							not "at" Google). My interaction with code at work is limited to reviewing the code base as
							the ultimate source of information when it comes to product funcionality and errors. As part
							of my job I investigate, reproduce, document and
							ultimately submit bugs to the Product Engineering Team.<br>
							I also try to be lazy and automate my tasks using Python, you might find some scripts
							here.</br><br>
							Whichever the reason is for you to be here, I hope you at least get an idea of who I am and
							how I think.<br><br>
							Cheers!

								<h3>Android</h3>
								<p>With billions of devices inside pockets around the world, the potential that Android
									has to turn an idea into an App that can impact so many people, is something that
									drives motivation. I enjoy the Android ecosystem and it's potential.</p>

								<h3>Java</h3>
								<p>A language like Java resonates quite well with my way of thinking. I don't mind the
									verbosity, on the contrary, I like to see every aspect of the code as explicitly as
									possible. Also, it's the first language that I had contact with back when I first
									interacted with <a href="https://www.processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a>.

								<h3>Python</h3>
								<p>No matter what I do, I always find myself back at Python. Usually for a script to
									automate a task, or parse and process data for another program. I plan to dig deeper
									into this language as I learn more about backend development.</p>

							<h3>Dublin Bus Alarm</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Android</li>
								<li>Java</li>
								<li>Firebase Realtime Database</li>
								<li>GoogleMaps API</li>
								<li>Python</li>
							</ul>
							<p>My dearest project (ongoing). When I used to live in Dublin, I would take the
								bus to and from work, and quite often I'd see people sleeping on the bus. I wondered how
								did the passengers know when to wake up to get out? Let me
								tell you, Dublin Bus service is not known for it's punctuallity.
								Maybe, there was a problem to fix! We usually use time based alarms to wake up, but
								here, time is not an invariant. So, what doesn't change regarding a bus route? The route
								itself! The sequence of stops will be the same, regardless of how long it takes for the
								bus to do it.
								Let's set an alarm based on location! And that's what Dublin Bus Alarm (I'm great with
								names, I know) does.<br>
								I would say my biggest challenge with this project was when the RESTful API I was using
								was deprecated and replaced with GTFS.
								As I only needed static data (no realtime data), I decided to parse all the GTFS files
								and extract everything that I needed regarding the routes,
								and structure that data in a way that retrieving it form Firebase would be easy.<br>
								Find out more about this project on it's GitHub repo!

							<h3>ImportEmail</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Python</li>
								<li>Gmail API</li>
								<li>PySimpleGUI</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This is an attempt to be more lazy and efficient at work. This script allows me to
								import/insert an email message into my Gmail account by just authenticating and
								selecting the file.
								It will do the encoding to base64_url using base64 lib, and creating the API request and
								calling the
								Gmail API, which are the steps that take the most time. <br>
								To make it even faster I also added a GUi (PySimpleGUI) that allow me to browse the .eml
								or .txt file containing the email and import it with one click.

							<h3>Restaurant Menu App Udacity</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Python</li>
								<li>HTML</li>
								<li>Flask</li>
								<li>SQLAlchemy</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This is the final project for a <a
									href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088"
									target="_blank">fullstack foundations course in Udacity</a>.
								My interest was more on the backend side of things, as previously mentioned.<br>
								Using Python, HTML, Flask and SQLAlchemy, and following the basic ideas behind agile
								development, I implemented the CRUD funcionality in successive rounds of development:
							<ol>
								<li>Routing</li>
								<li>Templates and Forms</li>
								<li>Implementation of DB and CRUD funcionality</li>
								<li>Basic JSON API endpoints</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Multiplayer TicTacToe</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Javascript</li>
								<li>HTML</li>
								<li>Web Sockets</li>
								<li>JQuery</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This project is for introducing myself to websockets, specifically
								through Socket.io. Its focus was to learn about the connection and
								communication between clients through a server, using websockets. <br>

							<h1>Che! Qué Plato!</h1>
							<p>OFF-TOPIC</p>
						</header>
						<p>This sections has nothing to do with programming, it's just so you know me a little bit
							better. <br>
							<strong><i>I. Love. Cooking.</strong></i> <br>
							Cooking is my second favourite thing to do, and I think it's a perfect complement to
							programming. Coding satisfies me at an intelectual level, scratches the itch to solve
							problems using logic, while cooking takes care of my more
							abstract, "artistic" side. <br>
							<strong>Che! Qué Plato!</strong> is a food blog that started during the pandemic's lockdown,
							cooking was
							indeed of great help to go through those times. <br>
							I'm currently working on remaking the site in Wordpress so I can continue to blog about this
							second pasion of mine.
